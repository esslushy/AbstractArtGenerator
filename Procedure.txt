This file will answer these questions:
1. What is your area of interest? What are you specifically going to investigate?
2. What dataset are you going to use to do your investigation?
    A. Provide a link
    B. Describe the format - is it a file, a website, a database, etc.
    C. How big is the dataset? How many rows and how many columns?
3. How are you going to collect your dataset? Is it a simple download or will you write a web crawler?
4. What is your procedure for conducting your investigation?
    A. What preprocessing will you do on your data?
    B. What machine learning techniques will you use (feel free to consult an instructor on any bullet, but especially here)?
    C. Is there any other software development necessary to conduct your investigation?
5. How will you evaluate your system once it has been built?

1. My area of interest is artwork. I will investigate how to make a computer learn to create a piece of art.
2. The dataset I am using is the BAM dataset at this link: https://bam-dataset.org/ . It is a sqlite database
and the one I am using has 1379284 rows and 5 columns in the place the pictures are stored.
3. The database is a download, but it comes with 7 different types of images. I am going to sort it and 
make my own set of images of the type I want, oil paint images. I will have it find and download all the images
under that label and put it into a folder to use.
4.I will search through the dataset and find all the links with images that are labeled oil paint, and then I will
download those images and put them into a folder. I will be using a generative neural network to develop new
paintings.
5. I will test my neural network by making it generate around 20-30 images and surveying people around my school
to rate the art.
