Quite a bit changed from my original project. First off the structure changed to being an array of 100 reshaped into 1024x4x4
and then convoluted multiple times until it reached 16x256x256 and then it passed through 1x1 convolutional layers until it reached
3x256x256 for my images. The discriminator is still the reverse of the generator as shown above. The generator has a constant
learning rate of .002 while the discriminatorhas a decaying learning rate from .001.
